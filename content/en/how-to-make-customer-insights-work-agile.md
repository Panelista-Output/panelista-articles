+++
The tried and tested methods are the agile development of the software world, the "Lean Startup" thinking of the startup world and the Service Design of the design world. What they have in common is a relentless focus on creating value for the customer using three pieces of the puzzle:

1\. Working hypothesis-driven from customer insights

2\. Do things in small value-creating steps

3\. Create fast feedback loops

The fact that you also reduce risk, cost and time from idea to launch when you prioritise accurately is something that the management team tends to like. So how do you make customer insights work agile?

\## Work hypothesis-driven from customer insights

Do you want to know in advance if customers will appreciate what you create? Start by finding out their needs, then create a hypothesis about how you will meet their needs and test that hypothesis in the easiest and fastest way possible. \~\~Everything is a hypothesis before it has met the customer\~\~.

\* Start by digging up insights that already exist or ask exploratory questions like _"How would you like it to feel/work when you...?"_ followed by follow-up questions to get down to the nitty-gritty.

\* Create a hypothesis based on the insights (not guesses!) and test the hypothesis with questions like _"We think it could work like this, what do you think?"_ or by showing a simple sketch/prototype.

You don't ask to find out what customers want, you ask to understand customers' needs and drivers in order to create hypotheses that you can test. Evaluate the needs you discover based on benefits to the customer and value to the company, and test hypotheses at the whiteboard stage. If it costs £10 to change the whiteboard, £1000 in the design, and £100,000 in the product, how early do you want to know if the hypothesis holds?

\## Do things in small value-adding steps

Just like in agile development, when working with customer insights you need to break down what you want to do into small pieces and prioritise what creates the most value right now. Achieve high speed and low risk through the agile principle of \~\~maximizing the amount of work not done\~\~.

\* Avoid doing preliminary studies on things that might be done in the future, most of what you explore that you don't have the capacity to act on in the near term is wasted anyway.

\* Supplement or replace large scheduled research projects with quick exploratory activities about what will soon become a reality.

\* Replace ready-made question sets with open-ended questions, adapting along the way and asking follow-up questions like _"Why?"_, _"Can you give an example?"_ and _"How would you like it to work instead?"_.

Most companies are now focusing more on qualitative methods with open-ended questions, discussions, interviews and observations. Not least data-driven startups that have a good grasp of behavioural data, analytics and metrics and are interested in complementing this with an understanding of why customers do what they do and testing new ideas for which there is no data yet.

\## Create fast feedback loops

The foundation of everything from agile development sprints, Lean Startup's Build-Measure-Learn loop, and Service Design's iterative experimentation is to quickly move through loops where you create a hypothesis, test it, learn. And start again.

\* Create the conditions to quickly discuss individual questions with customers (\[Panelista\]([https://panelista.com](https://panelista.com "https://panelista.com") "Panelista")) or book five in-depth interviews (\[Ethnio\]([https://ethn.io](https://ethn.io "https://ethn.io") "Ethnio")).

\* For many companies, it is also useful to create conditions for observing what customers do in an interface (\[Panelista touchpoints\]([https://articles.panelista.com/sv/nytt-i-panelista-touchpoint-feedback/](https://articles.panelista.com/sv/nytt-i-panelista-touchpoint-feedback/ "https://articles.panelista.com/sv/nytt-i-panelista-touchpoint-feedback/") "Panelista touchpoints")) or a physical environment.

\* Explore one focused area at a time and test hypotheses quickly and easily by describing an idea in a video and getting input from customers, creating simple sketches that you ask customers to reflect on aloud in interviews, or observing how customers react to a potential future offering.

Always include customer insights as part of your work, it should be as natural as checking with your stakeholders, proofreading texts or testing that new features work. Do NOT outsource what should drive your priorities to an agency or another department! \~\~It's absolutely critical that those creating new things for clients have direct access to customers and the tools to quickly engage them\~\~.

\[_Panelista_\]([https://panelista.com](https://panelista.com "https://panelista.com") "Panelista") _was developed specifically to create quick feedback loops with your clients. So you can explore needs and test hypotheses in a quick, personalized and structured way. You submit an open-ended question in a 30-second video, ask follow-up questions in an online discussion, and get an automated insight report. The first answers come in within an hour!_
